CNC Backlash Compensator
========================
If you have a home made CNC machine that has backlash on some axis, this program is able to modify your G-Code in order to compensate this backlash.

Movement compensation is added before every direction change.
CNC Backlash Compensator is a program written in C#, feel free to modify it according to your needs!
